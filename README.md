# Thirtynader Round Levels with Alert

This tool automatically draws psychological round number levels on the chartâ€”powerful zones where price often reacts. It also sends an alert when price approaches one of these key levels, helping traders stay sharp and focused.

## ðŸ”§ Main Features
- Adjustable level spacing (in points)
- Number of levels above and below price
- Built-in MetaTrader alert system
- Customizable colors, line style, and thickness

## ðŸ’¡ Why it matters
Round numbers act like magnets in the market. Whether you trade **XAUUSD**, **US30**, or any other asset, these levels often align with areas of **support/resistance**, **liquidity**, and **price reaction**. Combine it with your strategy like price action, MTR, or candlestick patterns, and it becomes a powerful confirmation tool.

The built-in **sound alert system** ensures you donâ€™t miss key trading opportunities as price approaches these psychological levels.
